Follow the pattern.\nGame rules:\n- Legal actions include:\n    - pickup_onion\n    - put_onion_in_pot\n        - I need to have an onion in hand.\n    - pickup_dish\n        - I need to have nothing in hand.\n    - fill_dish_with_soup\n        - A soup in a pot should be ready.\n        - I must have a dish in hand.\n    - deliver_soup\n        - I need to have soup in hand.\n        - The dish and soup with both disappear.\n    - place_obj_on_counter\n        - I need to have something in hand.\n    - start_cooking\n        - I need to have nothing in hand.\n        - The pot should have all the ingredients indicated by the recipe.\n    - wait(x)\n        - x indicates the number of timesteps I will wait\n- There will be dispensers, pot, serving loc and counters in the kitchen.\n    - Dispensers are where I could pick up objects. For example, I can pick up onions from the onion dispenser.\n    - I can only pick up something when there's a dispenser for it.\n    - A pot can a contain at most 3 ingredients.\n- Notice the recipe, as we need to follow the recipe to put the ingredients in the pot.\n- The pot will cook for 20 timesteps and then become soup ready.\n- We should start prepare for the next soup when we are done with the current one.\n- I can only hold one thing at a time. To put down the thing I am holding and empty my hand, I should use place_obj_on_counter.\n- When a pot has all the ingredients, someone should start cooking.\n- When the soup is ready, I am holding something that is not a dish, I should use place_obj_on_counter to put it down.\n- I can only pick up and hold one thing at a time.\n"},
