Assuming you are a python terminal. The skill given CANNOT be executed by me under the given scene. Let's check ALL the assertions in the skill function one by one and find the one which is not satisfied.

def pickup(obj):
    assert object_in_hand() == "nothing", f"I cannot pickup {obj}, since that hand is not empty."
    assert obj in ["onion", "dish"], f"I cannot pickup {obj}, since that this is a invalid object."
    return f"pickup(obj)"

def place_obj_on_counter(obj):
    assert object_in_hand() == obj, f"I cannot place {obj} on counter, since that this obj not in hand."
    return f"place_obj_on_counter({obj})"

def put_onion_in_pot(): # put one onion in pot
    assert object_in_hand() == "onion", f"I cannot put onion in pot, since that onion is not in my hand."
    assert pot_onions_count() < 3, f"I cannot put onion in pot, since that pot already has 3 onions and instead place_onion_on_counter."
    return "put_one_onion_in_pot()"

def fill_dish_with_soup():
    assert object_in_hand() == "dish", f"I cannot fill dish with soup, since that I have no dish in my hand and pickup(dish) first."
    assert soup_ready() or pot_started_cooking(), f"I cannot fill dish with soup, since that soup is not ready or pot not started cooking."
    return "fill_dish_with_soup()"

def start_cooking():
    assert object_in_hand() == "nothing", f"I cannot start cooking, since that hand is not empty."
    assert onions_in_pot() == 3, f"I cannot start cooking, since that pot has not enough onions and add more onions."
    assert not (soup_ready() or pot_started_cooking()), f"I cannot start cooking, since that pot has already started cooking."
    return "start_cooking()"

def deliver_soup():
    assert object_in_hand() == "soup_with_dish", f"I cannot deliver soup, since that a dish with soup not in hand."
    return "deliver_soup()"

def wait(x): # wait x timesteps
    assert 0 < x <= 20, f"I cannot wait(x), since that wait time can not be 0 or exceeded 20."
    return f"wait({x})"

###
- Condition in Assertion 1: xxxx. [Satisfied or not satisfied]. Reason: xxx.
- Condition in Assertion 2: xxxx. [Satisfied or not satisfied]. Reason: xxx.
.....
In all, the failed assertion is xxxx.
